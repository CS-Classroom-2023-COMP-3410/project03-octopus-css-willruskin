Started by determining the major elements apparent in the screenshot of the finished site. This includes the header, footer, main body, form, and table. One of the main challenges was matching spacing, alignment, and background colors since the screenshot did not provide exact measurements. I solved this by using relative units like percentages and margins. Positioning the image for the quiz was also tricky, but using `position: absolute` inside a relatively positioned container was what finally did the trick. Then it was some guesswork determined background colors for footer, header, quiz box and table which didn't take very long. Text size was determined cycling through h1-h6 or p for text until it looked correct. Other than that not too much difficulty.
